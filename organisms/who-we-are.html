                        <p>Dr. Maurice Ralph Hilleman (1919-2005) was the most prolific vaccine scientist of the 20th century. Often referred to as one of the most influential vaccinologists, he belongs to a distinguished group of pioneers who are credited with saving millions of lives through the development of over 40 vaccines.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hilleman began his career in the US Army during WWII where he developed vaccines against influenza and other diseases[NEAH1] . In 1957, he joined Merck Research Laboratories as a Director of Virus and Cell Biology and after his retirement in 1984, he served as a consultant in infectious diseases, a mentor to younger scientists and an advisor the World Health Organization (WHO). He was decorated with numerous awards and honours including the National Medal of Science, the highest scientific honour in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Hilleman was the first person to combine different viral vaccines into one shot with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and played a primary role in the research and development of numerous vaccines including:</p>
